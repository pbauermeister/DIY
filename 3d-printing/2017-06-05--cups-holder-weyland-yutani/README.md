Summary: 3D-printed cup holder for 6 espresso cups.

![Cups holder](cups-holder-med.jpg?raw=true "Cups holder")

## Design

Designed for cups with an outer diameter smaller then 60 mm with 2 mm spacing.

For other diameters, load the weyland-yutani-cup-holder.scad file in OpenSCAD, and set `RATIO` to fit your cups, with
```
RATIO = D/65, where D = diameter + spacing (typically 2)
```
all in mm.

## Printing instructions

Being a quite large piece, it's okay to print in draft mode, with 20% fill percentage. It took 18h on my CEL Robox.

Print all STL files in draft resolution, with 20% fill density.

- The STL file is generated by OpenSCAD (see the SCAD file). The logo projection, cups cavity, and diagonal side cuts are designed in Inkscape and exported as several DXF files (*) used by OpenSCAD.
- (*) Copy-paste part into new Inkscape files,
    - Fit document to drawing, remove background rectangle,
    - Flatten bezier paths,
    - Export as DXF
